# CAEDM GxEPD
A fork of https://github.com/ZinggJM/GxEPD made for the purpose of being used with https://github.com/caedm/wall-ink/

The only real difference we've made here is to make the \_buffer variable public instead of private; this is so that the contents of the screen can easily be hashed.

Many thanks to Jean-Marc Zingg for the work he's done to build this library!
